This was the Children , Young People and Education Committee 's eleventh evidence session on the Children ( Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Punishment ) ( Wales ) Bill . First of all , Barry Hughes , who is the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales , introduced how the law currently stands , and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment—how does the law as it presently stands protect children . Then , Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that there was a range of offences created by the criminal law , going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last , which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people , including , in particular , Acts such
Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that the law should reflect contemporary society and the law was evolutionary in nature , and should be evolutionary innature . And from what he had seen of the research , and from the 2007 review , there was evidence within that review already that opinions were changing . And he believed that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastizing a child than do people of an older generation .
Sian Gwenllian AM asked how the law as it currently stood today , and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment would protect children . Barry Hughes answered that there were a range of offences created by the criminal law , going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last , which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people , including , in particular , Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , which provides for offences that are specific to children . But the more general criminal legislation did provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault . In that regard , it could be argued that children have fewer rights than adults
The first stage is whether there 's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction , and the second stage is the public interest stage . If there is n't enough evidence , they do n't go on to consider whether it 's in the Public interest , because they would n't put an offence before the courts if they did n't think there was a realistic possibility of conviction . So , they only get on to the public interests stage once the evidential stage is satisfied .
The Deputy Minister suggested that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would in England , because the defense would still apply there . However , the Deputy Minister argued that the number of offences was likely to be very small and they would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case would probably be dealt with in Wales . The Deputy Minister also suggested that they would issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise .
According to Barry Hughes , there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than in England , because the defense would still apply there . That , therefore , raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales , because it 's fairly evident that there would not be a defense available in England that is not available in Wales . In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales , his approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that they issue nationally suits both England and Wales .
Barry Hughes did not think that the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test would necessarily be helpful . What they would envisage was that they would simply want to take the present public interest factors , which were set out , in his view , very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors , and would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that they were discussing here . And they would need to work that up as they went along , and they would run a risk of putting the cart before the horse , if I may put it like that .
There was quite a range , and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved . Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision would generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal . There may be cases where it 's genuinely very difficult to assess what 's the best approach , in which case they will have a conversation with them , a meaningful conversation , about what the best way to approach that particular case is .
The National Police Chiefs ' Council helped in out-of-court disposals because there were a great many offences or reports of crime that did not reach the CPS because they were dealt with by way of an out- of-court disposal . There was quite a range , and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved . Offences that the police referred to us for a charging decision would generally be offences where they felt that there should be a prosecution rather than an out of court disposal . We were n't responsible for administering the out-OF-Court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal , if it has conditions attached .
Barry Hughes suggested that within Wales , they could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals . They ca n't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that , but , if they build a good infrastructure , it 's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction .
Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that if someone in Wales was convicted of assaulting their child—in circumstances that would not have happened in England—then they would have a criminal conviction they would n't have in England , and that , inevitably , has an impact upon their life prospects . However , he believed that it was extremely unlikely that they even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases . They were likely to be very limited . When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales—this was the review in 2007—it spanned just over a two-year period , and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage .
Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that some people might go through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child , because they need to reach some target in terms of performance measures . However , Barry Hughes said that it was extremely unlikely . In the CPS , they did n't have targets for securing convictions or not . Clearly , we prosecute if we think that there 's a reasonable prospect , a realistic prospect , of conviction and it 's in the public interest , but we have no targets . And I would also say , because the numbers here are likely to be so small , any assertion of looking to meet targets is a tiny , tiny fragment of a
According to Karen Cornish , there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales , and the Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with that , and they had had a number of people who were now in a position to act as intermediaries . Now , of course , if they were to decide not to do that anymore , they may have a problem , but in turn , they would be looking to recruit more people into those positions . Therefore , it was not a barrier .
The team agreed that the remote control should be easy to use and easy to learn . The team also agreed that it should be fancy with a fancy look and feel . They also agreed on the idea of the scroll bar as a sort of shortcut and the voice recognition function as well . However , the team did not agree on the number of buttons on the remote .
The group agreed that the remote control was fancy in the way that fancy has a lot of fashion . The group also agreed that it was innovative in the sense that it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case , but they decided not to , because they could not use solar . Therefore , the group gave a two out of three to the product .
Industrial Designer thought the basic part of the remote control was easy to use for novice users , but the advanced functions were probably a bit harder . User Interface thought the voice recognition function was not easy to learn . Project Manager agreed that the advanced function was easier to use . However , Industrial Designer believed that an advanced user would find the voice function easy toUse .
The group agreed that the remote control offered enough features . However , they did not think it was competitive in the discussion of evaluation criteria of the remote . Project Manager thought that the basic layout did n't offer much , but the voice recognition mode could add a lot . Industrial Designer agreed that users could add very much functionality by using the voice control mode . The group also agreed that a regular programmable remote control contains a lot of buttons and is difficult to get used to .
Industrial Designer suggested that the group could make the remote control more attractive to young people by not using the voice recognition feature . However , Project Manager pointed out that this would add four Euros to the cost of the product . The group agreed to discard the idea of the solar cell because it was not that important . Project Manager also suggested changing the casing because he thought there was no added value in an enhanced case with these dull functions .
The group agreed that it was possible to make a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . However , they were concerned that the cost of the product would be above the budget . Project Manager suggested that they could still make a remote control that applied more to the young people by not using the voice recognition feature , which would add four Euro to the price . Project manager also suggested changing the casing , which was rejected by the group .
Industrial Designer proposed that the original remote control of any TV kind , a Phillips remote control , was more than fifty Euros , which was quite expensive . However , Industrial Designer believed that the new remote control would be easier to use because those remote controls did n't offer voice recognition and the new one would .
This meeting was about the functional design of the remote control . First of all , Marketing introduced the results of the usability test . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . The results showed that customers and users did n't like the way remote controls looked , the way they felt , and the way the buttons were designed . Therefore , the team decided to design the remote controls according to the user requirements . The team also agreed that the buttons should be easy to find , easy to use , and easy to lose .
The group discussed the functional design of the remote control . They agreed that the most important buttons were those to do with channel selection . They were used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . The other ones were the settings , and they were used less than ten per cent of the buttons . They decided to design according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button . They also agreed that they should design the remote controls to be user-friendly .
The group agreed that the finder button and call button should be on the remote control so that users can use it to find the remote . However , the Industrial Designer pointed out that it would have to be sold separately because if the sender was on the TV and the remote was not in the line of sight , it would not work . Therefore , the group decided to design a remote control with a button on a TV or on the wall or someplace else . The Industrial Designer suggested that the button could be attached to the TV to send out a signal so that the remote would beep when it got lost .
Marketing suggested that the target age group would be the nineteen to thirty-five range , which included teenagers and young professionals . Project Manager agreed with Marketing that it was a cool idea , but he was not sure how the group would implement it . He thought that to have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .
Project Manager suggested that the VCR / VHR / DVD capability button should be for general remotes . User Interface suggested that it would not be that hard to reduce the number of buttons on the remote control . Project Manager agreed and suggested that they could just design the channels , instead of a whole different set of buttons for everybody .
The meeting began with a review of the current state of the project . The team was concerned that the lapel was not too hot , not too cold , and far enough away that they got more background noise . They decided to use a wireless headset instead of a lapel because it was more convenient for the team . They also discussed how they could improve the performance of the model by reducing the number of buttons on the remote control . The meeting ended with a discussion on how the model could be further improved .
The professor explained that they abandoned the lapel because they were not too hot , not too cold , and they were far enough away that they got more background noise . On the other hand , the professor argued that the lapels were not so close that the interference was too close that it was not good to have one mike in the middle . The professor also pointed out that there was some kinds of junk with these things that they did not get with the lap .
PhD F explained that the team was putting in an order for twelve new machines to use as sort of a compute farm . The team was running P - make and Customs here and Andreas had gotten that all fixed up and up to speed . There were a number of little utilities that made it very easy to run things using P-make and Customs . Each machine had an attribute and it would only run on the fastest currently available machine . If there was already a job running , on some machine that was trying to select , the job would get queued up , and then when that resource was available , it would get exported there . There was a lot of nice features to it .
The professor explained that the workshop was about parallelization . The team was using all the machines and the professor wanted to make sure that the team did not saturate the network . The professor also mentioned that people should not run more than ten jobs at a time because it would keep other people 's jobs delayed . He also mentioned the Rutgers workshop .
The team was trying to figure out the best way to perform spectral subtraction on the FFT bins . The professor suggested doing it on FFT , but the team was not sure if it would be better if they did it on mel warped or whether it was better to do a linear weighting anyway . The team decided to do both and see which one was better .
The team was trying to find someone in Grenada who was working on VTS techniques , which are used to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy Cepstra . He was working in the cepstral domain and was using first-order or second-order Taylor Series to get rid of the noise and the channel effect . The team did n't know him .
The professor was confused about the difference between the signal subspace approach and the Wiener filter . The professor thought that combining two signals did n't work very well if the SNR was very bad . It was like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filters . He explained that the professor thought the professor was ignorant of the difference . He thought that the advantage of combining two things was mainly coming from the signal Subspace approach .
The meeting focused on how to get people to edit bleeps out of the transcriptions . The professor suggested that the team could use audio monitoring on some of the equipment to look for spikes in the recordings . The team also discussed how to make the corpus more robust . The meeting ended with a discussion about how to deal with the large number of meetings that have not been transcribers .
The professor suggested that the team could replace the wired mikes with wireless if they bought another base station and more wireless mikes . The team agreed that they could have up to six wireless receivers , and so they could replace their wired mike with wireless . The professor also suggested that they should get another wireless setup because it was expensive , but it did seem to be better than the wired .
The team wanted to make sure that everyone was on the same page with the recording conventions . The professor mentioned that SRI was also in the process of looking at stuff , and the team should try to keep everyone on thesame page with that . The team also wanted to ensure that the team was conscious about the batteries , which was the key .
The transcribers are working on a systematic handling of numbers and acronyms to ensure that the data are consistent all the way throughout the transcriptions . The next step is to insure that the recordings are clean first , and then channelized . The transcriber is working on the transcription of non-digits and non-digit data .
Transcribers were required to ensure that the data were clean first , and then channelized . This would include the incorporation of additional conventions that Liz requested in terms of having a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which had n't been specific about . The transcribers would have to be responsible for ensuring that the mark-up was consistent all the way throughout the transcripts .
The meeting began with a discussion about the basic design of the influence links in the model . The professor suggested that the team should spend at least part of the time trying to identify which sets of things are relevant to which decisions and which ones are not . The team also discussed the best way to design the model , which was to start with the belief-net , the general influence stuff , and then move to the more detailed analysis of what influences what done . The meeting ended with the team discussing how the model could be further improved .
The team was concerned that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . The professor suggested that the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he is he cheap , average , or spendy or they can even have a finer scale moderately cheap . The team agreed that it would be useful to keep a running total of things , which is like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend .
The group agreed that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . They wanted to keep a running total of things , which is like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend . The finance is sort of here thought of as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he is he cheap , average , or spendy .
The professor suggested that the Go-there decision would have a node from discourse , and the team could use the discourse as a placeholder . The professor also suggested that it would be useful to know how to find out how to get there without wanting to go there . The team agreed that the professor 's suggestion was a good one .
Grad E suggested that the Go-there decision would have a node from discourse , which would be specific for second year and would have three values . These would be the EVA values for the endpoint . The professor agreed and suggested that it would be a good idea to have the discourse as a placeholder for the decision .
The team wanted to figure out the best way to combine decision nodes in the belief-net . They wanted the probabilities to be weighted according to the influence of each of the decision nodes . They also wanted the probability of each decision node to be one . The professor suggested that the team could use a display hack or something to display the probabilities . The team agreed that it was a good idea .
Grad D explained that the way this was handled was by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what the H node looked at the four values of those guys and decided which of these was n't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . The function of the thing that came out of H was very different from the function of other inputs . It was driving how the other four were interpreted . H passed a vector on to the next node .
This meeting was about the functional design of the remote control . First , the User Interface Designer presented on the technical function design for user interface for the remote . Then , the Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the design of remote control with sophisticated functions and easy to use . After that , the Marketing Expert presented on user requirements for the product . The group decided that the product should be user-friendly and easy-to-use . Then the group discussed how to incorporate the functions of the internet into the product , and how to make the product more user- friendly . Finally , the group decided to design the product to be both powerful and user-oriented .
User Interface first presented the technical function design for user interface for the remote control . User Interface proposed to design a remote control with sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . Project Manager then proposed to have a powerful and easy-to-use remote control which would be both powerful and user-friendly . The team agreed on the product requirements . Then , User Interface presented the user interface design for the product . The user interface would be simple and easy to learn .
The user interface designer and the industrial designer recommended to design a remote control with sophisticated functions while with easy to use user interface . They mentioned that the remote control should be powerful , but with very powerful functions and very easy-to-use . However , the project manager pointed out that it would be difficult to merge the two systems and make it easier for users to use .
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control would be able to connect to the internet and surf the web . Project Manager disagreed with Industrial Designer because he did n't think the Internet was popular now . However , Industrial Designer insisted that the new requirements were important for the new remote control . The group agreed on the idea and agreed on it .
The Industrial Designer first presented the industrial design of the remote control . The Industrial Designer proposed a nifra infrared base with a bulb and an infrared bulb , which was cheaper and less technology than the conventional one . However , the User Interface preferred a wireless remote control because it was easier to manage and the battery problem could not be solved by using a battery or a wire to connected the device . The User Interface also proposed to have a remote control without a cable . The Project Manager agreed with the Industrial Designer and User Interface .
The project manager disagreed with the industrial designer because he did n't think the user would be ready to have a wireless control . He thought that a cable between the remote control and the TV would n't be a good idea because it would be easier to have the link between the TV and the television , which was more practical . However , the project manager did not think it was too much to ask the user if he would like a wireless remote control .
The user interface designer recommended to have a switch menu to switch between control TV and control the recorder , so that users could have fewer buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control . However , the project manager was not sure that it would be easy to use because if many functions just for one button would be quite difficult for the user to know . Therefore , the User Interface Designer suggested that they could mix several function in one button . This would have less buttons .
The user interface designer suggested that the remote control should be fancy , but the project manager pointed out that it would increase the price of the production of the remote controls . The user interface manager suggested that they could have several options , such as the personalised colour . However , the industrial designer argued that this would cost more . The project manager disagreed with the user interface design designer and suggested that it was better if the product was simple and uniform for some people and fancy for other peoples .
The user interface designer and the industrial designer agreed that the product appearance of the remote control should be simple and uniform . However , the project manager pointed out that if the product was to have special colours for remote controls , it would cost a little bit more , which would increase the price of the production of the product . Therefore , the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer proposed to have several options so that users can select which colour they prefer .
The project manager was concerned that the special colours for remote controls would increase the price of the production of the remote control . Project Manager believed that the product should be fashionable and the image of the society should be recognized by the users . Besides , the project manager wanted the product to be easy to use , powerful and user-friendly so that users could select which colour they prefer .
This was the 20th meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic . Hon . Bill Blair ( Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness ) introduced the 2019 annual report on the RCMPs use of the law enforcement justification provisions . This report addresses the RCMP 's use in the enforcement of specified provisions within the law Enforcement justification regime , which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the Criminal Code . The report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used . The committee members then presented two petitions . One was an e-petition , and it related to the threat to pollinators globally . The petitioners called on the Government of Canada to
The committee members praised the industrious people of Sudbury who had risen to the challenge and joined forces in the face of COVID-19 , including first responders , volunteers , health care and essential workers , local miners , the farmers and produce growers who were feeding the families , and local businesses who were staying connected with their staff . They also praised all the homegrown innovations such as ProStitch and King Sportswear face masks ; Nobel Prize winner SNOLAB 's work on ventilators , which earned a federal contract ; Vale Canada 's $ 1 million in seed capital to small firms developing COVD-19 health solutions ; and many more . They were all in the same boat .
The opposition party alleged that the government had tabled $ 87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study , debate and pass it . The allocated time was wholly inadequate . Canadians deserved to know how that money was being spent . They needed to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament . It was Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who would have the responsibility to pay for this government 's spending . Canadian workers and businesses would have to do the hard work of rebuilding the economy . A rubber stamp under the guise of health and safety was not democracy .
According to the committee members , unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member Romeo Saganash , whose commitment I commend , to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the Viens commission in Quebec . However , according to Mr. Steven Mackinnon , there are already potential solutions for taking action . Commissions have been issuing reports for decades , and Ottawa has been tabling them . The federal government must work with indigenous peoples , Quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces . Civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the RCMP . Police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures .
Hon . Justin Trudeau suggested that the Prime Minister was doing everything to avoid being accountable to Canadians . He was refusing to table a budget , refusing to provide an economic update and refusing to let the House of Commons do its work . The Prime Minister wanted the Auditor General to be able to examine that government spending , and her ability to conduct audits was being affected . However , the opposition party argued that under the government , she would be unable to deliver 14 performance audits each year , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . Hon .Justin Trudeau insisted that the government would continue to demonstrate openness and transparency .
According to the opposition party , the Prime Minister 's plan was only going to help 40 % of Canadians living with disabilities . The opposition party argued that the government was not allowing the CERB to be extended . The Prime Minister assured the committee that they would continue to be there for them and support them , as they have been . However , this answer was challenged by Mr. Jagmeet Singh , who pointed out that there was a vast majority of Canadians with disabilities who were not receiving enough support .
Hon . Carla Qualtrough assured the committee that the government was very aware and deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on women and girls , and was working hard to ensure that everyone has the supports they need . As the pandemic evolves and as they move into economic recovery , of course they are going to make sure that women in particular are supported in the measures . However , the opposition party pointed out that the GBA+ analysis was still not conducted .
The project manager introduced the new remote control project . The remote control would be an international remote control that would be sold in the entire world , and the product cost would be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . The team members were asked to draw their favourite animals on the whiteboard and make a list of their favourite characteristics . Then , the project manager announced that the product would be priced at 25 Euros and the selling price of the product will be twenty-five Euros , which is quite reasonable . Then the team was asked to work on the design of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . The project manager suggested that the team members should be familiar with each other .
The team agreed that the remote control should be original , trendy and user-friendly , and the product cost should be under 12 Euros and 50 Euros . The team also agreed that it should be an international remote control , which would be sold in the entire world , so that the cost of the product would be not more than 12.5 Euros .
Project Manager proposed that the product should be international because they wanted to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs would be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . Project Manager also suggested that the remote control should be user-friendly so that everybody would have to use it , which was the same as keyboards .
The team agreed that the selling price of the product would be twenty-five Euros , which was quite good price and not too expensive . However , they had to keep the product cost under 12.5 Euros to maximize the benefit and make the product easy to use . Therefore , the team agreed to keep it under 12 Euros and 50 Euros .
Industrial Designer would work on the design of the remote control . User Interface would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the control so that the user could use it . Marketing would design the user requirement specifications . Project Manager would manage all the group 's work .
The industrial designer believed that the user interface designer would design how the remote control would look like and how the object would look . The industrial designer thought that the function design was the outside and the inside of the product . The user interface design was to design the relation between the user and the remote controls .
The user interface designer would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control so that the object would look like . The industrial designer would take care of the industrial way to transform it . User Interface would implement the core functions in the product and would design the function of the product .
The meeting began with a presentation on the current state of the project . The team was discussing how they could make the project more flexible and user-friendly . The meeting ended with a discussion on how the team could incorporate more advanced features into the model , such as the ability of the model to deal with different linguistic units , and how the model could be modified to fit into the context of the building .
Grad B explained the structure of the belief net . The first layer was to add a middle layer of features that have been drawn from the communication of some abstract idea , like `` I am a tourist I want to go to this place '' . The second layer is to set up features along the lines of where the user wants to go and what they 've said previously and what the means that they should use . The third one is to figure out whether the user is in a hurry or not .
The first step on features was to figure out what kind of going there is is happening . The second step was to find a limit on the number of times a person can change their mind in the middle of the discourse . The third step was the introduction of a new module , the discourse history , which is one of the most elaborate elaborate modules in the system . It is designed to store the whole memory of the entire system , which means that even without an anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here . The fourth step is to find out what the exact cost of each feature is . The fifth step is the identification of features .
The team discussed the intentionality of the features they wanted to include in the model . They wanted to make sure that the feature they were looking for , the landmark- iness , was not attached to the model at all . The team also wanted to figure out how they could make the model more flexible . They decided to make the feature of the landmark into a separate feature .
The middle layer would have features along the lines of where the user wanted to go and what they 've said previously and what the means that they should use . The features would be drawn from the communication of some abstract idea , like `` I want to go to this place '' . The hidden variables would be used to figure out whether the user was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry .
The importance of SmartKom is that it helps in the anaphora resolution and helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . It helps an anaphoras resolution and it fills in all the structures that are omitted in the discourse . The parser parses it and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is one of the most elaborate elaborate modules in the entire system .
The team agreed that they should have a trial run with Fey to see if she can actually do all the spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that they expect of the wizard . The team also agreed that one of the subjects should be the first subject of the trial run , which would be someone who is familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so that they can see if they are good .
This meeting was about the design of a remote control that was original , trendy and user-friendly . To achieve this , the team members drew their favourite animals on the whiteboard to sum up the characteristics of that animal . They drew a dolphin , a cat , a dog , a butterfly and a butterfly . The team agreed that the dolphin was their favourite because it was cute and they liked swimming and they were graceful . They also liked the interaction and the reasons people seem to like the dolphin .
The group drew their favourite animals on the whiteboard to sum up the characteristics of that animal . Project Manager suggested that the remote control should be original , trendy and user-friendly . However , User Interface and Industrial Designer disagreed with each other on whether the product should be functional , trendy , user friendly or both . User Interface preferred the former because he thought it was more satisfying . Industrial Designer preferred the latter because he believed that the former was more user- friendly and more convenient .
User Interface proposed to design a call button on the television to be able to find the remote control . Project Manager agreed with User Interface that the point of having a remote was not to have to walk over to the TV to find it , which was why it was always in the couch . However , Project Manager was concerned that it would not be easy to find .
Marketing suggested that the remote control should be bigger to not lose . However , the user interface designer argued that it would not be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it . Project Manager disagreed with the marketing . User Interface suggested that they could make it mobile so it would run around and come come find you . This would be a good idea .
User Interface suggested that the remote control should not have too many buttons . Project Manager agreed and suggested that a screen could be attached to the telly screen so that users could program the TV screen with the programming function . However , Project Manager pointed out that the cost limit was twelve point twelve fifty and the budget was 12.5 Euros .
Project Manager suggested having a clip on the remote control so that users could clip it to their hands . However , this idea was challenged by Marketing , who pointed out that it would not be good for users ' hands to sweat a lot . Project Manager disagreed with Marketing and suggested that a simple thing like a clip could be put on it so that it was more user-friendly .
The group agreed that the selling price goal was twenty-five Euros and the profit aim was fifty million Euros . They would hope to sell the product internationally , which would do four million Euros in the first year , which was a lot . The group also agreed that a profit for each unit of the product would be twelve fifty Euros .
The meeting began with a brief discussion on how the model could be trained on the task data . The team was concerned that the model was not performing as well as they expected it to . The professor suggested that they could train the model on the same set of digits data and see if the model would perform as well on different linguistic features . The meeting ended with a discussion on the model 's performance on the silence detection task .
The professor thought that the effect of training on different languages was not so much that they got hurt because they did n't have so much representation of English , because in the other case they did not get hurt any more , at least when it seemed like it was a case that they had something that was just much more diverse . The professor also suggested that they have to be cognizant of the fact that different languages have different representations of the same thing .
PhD D explained that the multilingual net was trained on features without the derivatives but with increased frame numbers . The model performed slightly better when the model did not use delta . However , the model performed worse when it included multiple languages . PhD D also explained that if the model was added in the English , the results were still not great .
The professor thought that it was not so much that they got hurt because they did n't have so much representation of English , because in the other case they had something that was just much more diverse , but they had the same number of parameters representing it . The professor also wanted to make it clear that they had never just trained on one language and tested on another .
The team wanted to make sure that the model was not too complicated . They wanted the model to be able to handle multiple nets with fewer out outputs . They also wanted to figure out a way to make the model more flexible . The professor suggested that they could use the same number of nets to train the model . The team thought that changing the labels to retrain the model would be useful .
The team was concerned about how many more parameters they could afford to have , in terms of the computational limits . They had originally hoped to get eight hundred megahertz processors , but they only got two so far , and more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of memory . The professor suggested that they could do things on Linux , but it would be a pretty fast Linux machine .
The team was concerned that the LDA would introduce delays but they were claiming that it was within the boundaries of it . The professor explained that the temporal LDA did in fact include the same so that the delay would work in the same way . The team was unsure about the difference between TLDA and SLDA . They wanted to know what the difference was .
This was the third meeting on the project . Project Manager firstly presented on the progress of the project and the team was asked to give a presentation on the current market situation . Then , the team members gave their presentations on the design of the remote control . The team agreed that the new remote control should be designed for the younger group , and it should have a fancy look and feel . They also agreed on the idea of using the LCD screen on the screen , which they thought was a good idea . Then the team discussed the design for the buttons , and decided that the buttons should be in the shape of fruits and vegetables , and they should be easy to use .
The group decided that the remote control should be designed for the young target group , which is mainly made up of fruit and vegetable-loving people . The group also agreed that the colour of the control should not be too bright or too dark , and that the buttons should be easy to use and easy to find . Also , the group agreed on the idea of having a fancy look and feel on the control .
Marketing suggested that the young target group liked fruit and vegetables in their clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they wanted a spongy material . User Interface suggested that they could make a few very colourful ones , and a traditional cover in traditional colours , and the feel of the material had to be spongsy . Project Manager agreed and suggested the group should use soft materials and make it colourful .
The team agreed that the feel of the material has to be spongy . However , they did n't want the remote control to be too hard . Since the team was concentrating on the younger group , they decided to use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones with exchangeable covers .
Industrial Designer suggested that the single-curved design was the best of two worlds . It was a more advanced shape , which was curved in three dimension . The team agreed that the curved one was a bit like a wave form , and it was a little more advanced in its shape .
The user interface controls of the remote control would include push-buttons and scroll-wheels , which could also be integrated with buttons . User Interface did n't think there was any possibility for the group to use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . Project Manager suggested that the group could make four push- buttons in a form of a round . Industrial Designer agreed that it was a good idea . However , the user interface designer did not think it would be a great idea because it would not be different from the traditional devices .
The team did n't want to use scroll-wheels because it would be different from the traditional devices on the market and it would attract young customers . However , the Industrial Designer suggested that the team could integrate a scroll-wheel with a button on it . But the User Interface did not think it was a good idea because it was not the same as the push-buttons .
Industrial Designer suggested that if the team wanted to use the LCD display , they could use the advanced version , which was a bit more costly . However , User Interface did not think it would add an extra high-tech feeling to the product because the team already had the scroll-wheels , the speaker , the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours and the fancy buttons .
This was a further evidence session on the inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification . Dafydd Evans , who is chair , ColegauCymru , and chief executive officer of Grŵp Llandrillo Menai ; Kay Martin , principal of Cardiff and Vale College , also representing ColegaoCymaru ; Nick Brazil , who was deputy principal , Gower College Swansea , also represented ColegAUCymul ; Dr Rachel Bowen , director of policy and development at Coleganka , and Ed Evans , the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association , answered questions from Sian Gwenllian AM and Sian
According to Dafydd Evans , employers did n't think that employers had a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac means or what it includes . They wanted them to get their main qualifications and they want them to have digital skills . They were having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales , and changes to qualifications . Most of what they were questioning was the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within those professional sectors .
The Welsh baccalaureate gave pupils who had come through from a less academic background the ability to pursue so much of an academic focus , but to test them in terms of the challenges , but also , to learn a lot more directly from industry . And if it was working properly and they did have employers engaged in this , and supporting schools and colleges to deliver it , they would actually be learning a lot More directly from the industry .
Dafydd Evans suggested that they need to review the qualification , and the voice of employers should be a key part of that review , so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within the qualification . And the only way to get employer buy-in is if they feel ownership of what 's being done . They need to link up the contractual clauses , which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools .
Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities . There was a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a C grade in the core subjects , but that ate into the time that we had to teach young people . And so there was no room for everything in the curriculum somehow , no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications . The Welsh baccalaureate was a combination of qualifications ; it was not just one qualification . To develop the employability skills obviously was a key part , and developing the skills for employment was another .
The Welsh baccalaureate did help prepare learners for employment , but it was not for everyone , because some people had to do the other things . Some people doing the equivalent of three A-Levels , even in a vocational programme , it was too big for them . They were coming from schools , some of them with very few GCSEs , or they had n't got literacy and numeracy skills , they were being tested and many of them were below level 1 in terms of literacy . So , it needed to be reviewed , to look at how we could make skilled and employable people .
According to Dafydd Evans , one of the problems was that they had a number of children coming in to the colleges , and they needed to resit their GCSEs—in maths , English and Welsh . It was a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a C grade in the core subjects , but that eats into the time that we have to teach young people . So , the priorities across the sector have given priority to GCSE resits rather than doing the Welsh bac at present . There are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they are resitting their GCSAs , and there is much more use of the Welsh
Dafydd Evans believed that universities in the main did not understand the value of the baccalaureate , especially the experience they had with some of their learners to go to Russell Group universities . They did allow sometimes that you could drop a grade in order to get into a Russell Group university because she had the Welsh bac as well , but it was a very paper-based exercise . In some areas , and certainly the local universities around here—University of South Wales , Cardiff Metropolitan University—value it in a great number of subjects , particularly in sport , when our students went to Cardiff Met , and business studies , when their learners went to USW . But some of the universities
Nick Brazil ( deputy principal ) thought that it was important that universities understood the value of the Welsh baccalaureate . He explained that the Seren programme that was put in by the Welsh Government was looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , which meant that Welsh students were fighting for places against Scottish , Northern Irish and English students who were studying three subjects , whereas their Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s , three A-Level subjects plus the bac . This added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they were trying to get possibly three A * grades .
Because of the nature of the catchment area , there is a greater percentage of the students staying in Welsh universities , and , as Kay said , Welsh universities are much more willing to recognize the bac . Therefore , to a certain extent , it is less of a problem . But , naturally , they do have students who are looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group , and they are having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities .
According to Dafydd Evans , training is required regarding the baccalaureate , but where they are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board . When they were bringing lecturers from outside—'Welsh bac specialists ' in inverted commas—it was not working well . It has started to work well when our sports lecturers had taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum . Therefore , no , if it 's going to be a success , it has to be contextualized , and for the vocational lecturer to do that , and they have invested heavily in training those vocational Lecturers
Dafydd Evans ( chair of ColegauCymru ) was not assured that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on . He thought that if it was going to be a success , it had to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and they had invested heavily in training those vocational Lecturers to understand how to deliver this . It had been an intensive staff development process .
Nick Brazil ( deputy principal ) suggested that the number of the skills and the challenges that were done within the Welsh bac were done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well , so a number of those staff had already got those skills and they were undertaking that . However , he was concerned that the work was being repeated twice , because of the nature of the qualification , which was taking away from the fact that they had got staff who had got the skills , and were developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications .
This was an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government 's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales . Kirsty Williams AM , Minister for Education ; Steve Davies , director of the education directorate ; and Claire Bennett , deputy director for curriculum and assessment gave evidence on the draft curriculum . The meeting started with the main messages that the government had received during the feedback period on theDraft curriculum . There was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement , knowledge and opportunity as possible . Approximately 120 separate events were organised , and in the region of 6,000 headteachers , teachers , governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in
According to Kirsty Williams AM , the original proposal was to provide for the four purposes of the legislation , which were literacy , numeracy and the digital competency . Then , below that , they were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy , the digital Competency , as well as some elements where they had already said that they were Going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports . They would also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out the approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas .
According to Kirsty , the area of learning and experience for well-being was already there , and underneath that section of learning title , there were the broad concepts of what matters , what we believe matters , in that area of Learning , and it was that that they would now actually put into the legislation .
Claire Bennett first introduced that the 'what matters ' were the articulation of the big ideas . The idea was to make sure that those were consistent , and then that still left huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those , which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them . They were always intended to represent , as a whole , the learning that every learner should get . They wo n't be literally in the Bill , because obviously , you might want to change the emphasis , so that 'll be provided for in subordinate legislation , but the provision will be there , and they will have the status of something that 's not optional , basically , for a school .
According to Kirsty , the curriculum on its own can play a part , but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it . And that is strong leadership of the schools that ensures that there is no segregation , that has high expectation of all of our children , and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there . Secondly , excellent teaching . In the end , no education system , whatever its curriculum , can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of their children day in , day out . And then , finally , the well-being of the child was put on the agenda .
The WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams would certainly buy into what the management teams were saying , but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical . They spent a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they were going to be held accountable for their practice , but what they wanted to do was provide reassurance that they were devising an accountability regime for the system that was in line with the purposes of the curriculum and put the system in the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems .
According to Kirsty Williams , the curriculum was not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum , but it was always useful to reflect on how other systems had undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen . Hefin David AM suggested that there was a process , a model for this , which is Scotland . Kirsty agreed that it was critical , but they had embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of the curriculum assessment group . They feed in throughout—not 'do n't do this because Scotland has done it ' , but feed some of that learning into the system .
According to Kirsty , the money was being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think , 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school . We are also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . The next stages will be much more focused on individual AoLE and area-specific professional learning .
According to Kirsty Williams , the money that was agreed was for a two-year period and , clearly , I continue to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning , and I 'm sure this committee and the members of this committee could help me in that task .
According to Kirsty Williams , all of the schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase , which is innovation schools , and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us , going forward . The innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as they do the final refinement , and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues .
According to Kirsty , Children 's rights , human rights were key considerations throughout the design , and this was currently set out in overarching guidance and they continue to work with the children 's commissioner 's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience . And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period . They undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people , as I said at the beginning . They had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms . The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn
According to Kirsty Williams , they had a separate programme of work that was looking at resources that were needed to support the curriculum . It was one of the conversations I had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that they had had previously , where we had new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications were n't available . So , they were already having those conversations with Qualification Wales and there was a piece of work ongoing to look at what were the resources that are necessary toSupport the curriculum , and this proposal by the Learned Society would be considered as part of that work .
According to Kirsty Williams , it was really important that whatever resources they had to support the Welsh dimension were really broad and not confined to specific areas . The continuum for language would have to be contextualized depending on the setting where a child was being taught . There would be progression points on that continuum that would be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language , and they would be contextualised . And by the end of primary school they would in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school . So , they have to contextualize that learning continuum Depending on the medium of tuition with the school .
The meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control . The first step was the functional design , which was to look at the needs of the users , the effects of thefunctional design , and and how the control would work . The second was the detailed design , in which the user interface was to be designed to be user-friendly and original . The third was the technical design , including the components and the properties and the specifications of the user Interface .
The group agreed that the remote control should have a lot of functions and it should be a universal one , so that it can be used from everywhere in the room . It should not be too small or too big , and it must be a very good control so that users can use it from every room in the house . The group also agreed on the idea of using advanced techniques to make the control more user-friendly , such as the use of the LCD screen .
The Project Manager thought that the remote control should be a universal remote control because they sell it apart from the television and not with the television . However , the Project Manager was not sure if it was a universal control for twenty-five Euros because he did n't think you could buy a a universal one for twenty five Euros , but he thought it would be better if they just said that it 's universal .
The Marketing thought that a touch screen on the remote control would be too expensive and was not reachable . The Industrial Designer thought it would be better if there were buttons on it to keep it easy and small . However , the User Interface disagreed with the Industrial Designer because he thought a touchscreen would be much too expensive .
Industrial Designer suggested to put the remote control in a home station to put it on the television and just recharge . However , this idea was challenged by the Project Manager because he did n't know what the project 's projection costs were for such a thing . Industrial Designer suggested that it was still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it was too expensive . But Industrial Designer also suggested to use it as a separate option .
Marketing suggested that the buttons on the remote control should be in usable places and the on-off button should be on top . User Interface suggested that buttons that users use often should be put on the same place , like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume on top , so that users can easily find it . Project Manager agreed with User Interface and Industrial Designer that the button layout should be as simple as possible .
The User Interface suggested to have the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume on top , so that the user can see . However , the User Interface also suggested to do a lot of testing to see if the new remote control would work .
The meeting was about the collection of more meeting data . The team was concerned that the amount of meeting data they were collecting would not be sufficient for their work . They wanted to collect more data to help them understand what was happening in the code . They also wanted to know what was causing the problem and how they could solve it . The meeting ended with the team discussing how to deal with the problem .
PhD F suggested that the team should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . He also suggested that they should have a fair amount of random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and if they can get more from them , fine , but if they only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically .
Postdoc E suggested that the meeting should be a pre-existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . The accent was not the problem . It was more a matter of proficiency , just simply fluency . Postdoc E said that sometimes people in computer science had language skills that were not so strong because their fluency and writing skills were not as strong as expected .
PhD F suggested that the team could set up a room in the linguistics department in another building where they could record people there . However , the professor pointed out that this would require a real motivated partner to do this . The team agreed that they should find someone on campus who was interested in the project . The professor also suggested that one of them could go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down .
The group agreed that the remote control could be turned into a portable one so that it could be wheeled around . However , the professor also raised the point that it would be difficult to put a lot of head phones in different people when they had to record only with only with the tabletop microphones . The professor also suggested that the team could also have one or two meetings of each of a range of meetings and that was OK .
Grad B informed the team that the team was slowly getting to the point where they had enough room to record meetings . Grad B was doing a bunch of archiving , and was in the midst of doing the P- files from Broadcast News . It would take another eleven to do the clone . The archiving program did take a long time , but once it was archived , it was pretty quick to get back .
The SUN rack took more disks than the Andatico one did , so the team was looking into other vendors . The team was concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non- backed-up disk . They needed to get the old stuff off the disk , but it was not going to happen instantaneously .
This meeting was about the design of the remote control . Project Manager firstly introduced the new remote control project and the team was asked to give a presentation on what the product was going to like . The team members firstly gave a presentation about the prototype of the product . Then , the team discussed the functional requirements of the new product . They agreed that the product should not be a universal remote control and it should be a TV remote control only . They also agreed that it should not only be for kids and elderly , but also for people of all ages . The meeting ended with a discussion on the market trend and the user requirements .
Firstly , the group discussed the functional requirements of the product . They agreed that the product should not be a universal remote control , but a TV remote control only . They also agreed that it should be a remote control for kids and elderly . Then , they discussed the results of the experiment . The group agreed that they needed to make the product more user-friendly . They wanted the product to be easy to use and easy to be held .
Marketing suggested giving up on speech recognition because it was not reachable for twenty-five Euros and it would be hard to sell a remote control for only television . However , the project manager argued that it was the exercise . Marketing disagreed with the Project Manager because he thought it was too expensive to make a remote controls for only TV .
Marketing suggested that the remote control should be simple so that the elderly people can use it , but User Interface pointed out that there were already so many controls out that support a lot of stuff . Therefore , User Interface suggested that they should make the product special by making it stand out by just the looks of it .
User Interface suggested that the basic functions of the remote control should be easy to use , so that it does n't take much time to figure out how to use it . Project Manager agreed and suggested using questionnaires on the internet to find out what people use and what they want on a remote control . However , User Interface pointed out that it would be hard for users to remember the exact number of each button on the remote controls .
The meeting began with the User Interface 's presentation on the prototype of the remote control . The user interface designer first presented the basic elements of the prototype , including the look-and-feel of the product , the material of the case , the buttons , the functions , and the functions of the advanced chip for speech recognition . Then , the project manager presented the budget of the project , which was set at 12.5 Euros . The project manager then asked the team to design the inside of the device , which would include the buttons and the buttons for controlling the device . The team agreed that the buttons should be made of plastic and the material should be hard plastic , colour changeable and transparent .
The group agreed that the fancy and fancy look-and-feel of the remote control were mutually exclusive . The fancy part was that it was more like the iPod , with the flashing lights and the colours and that kind of stuff . Therefore , the group decided to give a one to seven out of ten to evaluate the product based on the evaluation criteria of the market research .
The group agreed that the first layer of the remote control was easy to use , but the second layer was not as fast as a usual remote control . The first time the user got the remote controls in their hands , it was not to use the scroll wheel , but to seek for it , and up or down . The rest of it was easy because there were so few information that the user could easily decide what buttons were for what function .
Marketing recommended to make a power indicator to let users know how far the device was charged up and a button to call it to let it beep . Marketing also suggested that the product should be under the logo so that it could be usable . However , Marketing also pointed out that the production cost of the product would be 12.3 Euros .
The team agreed that the drawing board would be a good addition to the remote control , but not as the main function . It would be better if users could edit it from a mouse , from where they were sitting , rather than from the computer . The team also agreed that it would be easier to draw on the board itself instead of using a digital pen .
User Interface believed that the team got the wrong information at the wrong time . The team was not satisfied with the results of the third meeting because they did not agree with every aspect of the team 's discussion . Therefore , User Interface suggested that they could have had a quicker discussion with the team if they knew the prices before .
The group decided to use a kinetic charger with a standard chip so that it could come in various sizes . The case material would be soft , rubbery , changeable and changeable . There would be buttons with a combination of LCR and rubber according to the design . The buttons at the bottom would be anti-RSI and the buttons would be made of rubber . The group also decided to incorporate voice recognition software into the design until they could find out more about the cost of things like that . Then , the group discussed how to design the remote control .
The group agreed that the new remote control should have a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , and it should incorporate current fashion trends . However , they were still ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy . Therefore , the group decided to use a seven-point scale to evaluate the product .
Marketing thought that the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype was a good idea because it incorporated the market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . However , he was concerned that the rubber case would be in the rubber that was put around the remote control , which was not the same as the base colour of the prototype .
The project manager suggested that the type of button that they were going to use in the bottom half , the material , minimises RSI because it was meant to be . Project Manager also suggested that with the size of the remote control , the amount of stuff they were putting on it was n't that much , so it was not moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .
The group agreed that the double-curved remote control would be a flat bottom with one curve , but it would be slightly flattened at the bottom so it did n't roll over . The group also agreed that they could not use a lot of rubber because they were using a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . However , the group decided to use a combination of plastic and rubber .
User Interface thought that the replacement of the kinetic batteries would not make a huge difference to the cost of the remote control . The biggest one would be taking away the customers ' preference for the standard battery . User Interface also pointed out that the customers had not said anything about the battery . However , User Interface did not think that changing the battery would be a bad idea .
Industrial Designer thought that the incorporation of voice recognition would make the remote control more attractive to customers because they were willing to pay more for better product . However , the project manager did not agree with the industrial designer because he did not think it would be a good idea to take away the voice recognition because it would not make the product competitive with other products in the market . Therefore , he suggested that they could offer the voice control initially to business class customers .
This was an evidence session for the inquiry on education otherwise than at school , and it was mainly about the increase in the number of exclusions from school . First of all , Nick Williams , director of education , Swansea city and county council , and representing the Association of Directors of Education in Wales suggested that the main reasons were the prevalence of ASD—autism spectrum disorder and trying to get the learners the right provision was sometimes a challenge . Then , Sharon Davies , head of learning , Torfaen County Borough Council , suggested that they needed to make sure that the staff and the schools were well-equipped to meet these needs , but there would always be some learners who needed more specialist provision . Then
Sian Gwenllian AM asked whether the new Act was going to lead to more exclusions , because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges , and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusion . Sharon Davies answered that it was not sure whether it was being worse affected , but certainly there 's pressure , in particular with the new sector coming in , and that 's going to place more pressure on the system . And on the additionallearning needs side , while the Minister had currently made some more money available , they had to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners , then , and it did place additional pressure on schools .
Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that the legislation would put pressures on , not just local authorities and schools , but also on the post-16 sector , because they were talking now about a wider age range—doing up to 25 as well . However , David Hopkins insisted that the levels of delegation had no impact on that . The delegation levels were already very high in most authority areas , and they had agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money , or as much money as possible , was devolved to schools .
The delegation levels were already very high in most authority areas , and they had agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money , or as much money as possible , was devolved to schools . Therefore , he did n't think that the levels of delegation had any impact on that .
According to Nick Williams , one of the things that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector . They meet on a regular basis , and that 's nationally , and the EOTAS group meets regionally as well . They put on some very good conferences as one form of professional learning . And they 're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider , or it 's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits , joint visits , to provision and also using the expertise that they do have within the sector to work more closely with the schools , and vice versa , particularly around the curriculum .
The more challenging the learners are the ones who are coming to the end of their statutory education , the more difficult it is to get them back into mainstream . It is far , far more difficult when they 're 15 , 16 toget them back in mainstream . So , then you are looking more at how you transit , then , into further education and colleges and so on . It comes back to that team-around-the-family approach , to ensure what is needed for that learner to go back into school , what can the school provide . It 's looking at the whole package of support , that surrounds not just the learner but the family .
The team-around-the-family approach was the solution to the major challenge for the transition of the excluded students . The schools worked together as a partnership , then , so that they could n't keep moving the children around , the learners around . It was looking at how well that worked . It started off really well , but that was a few years ago , so I do not know whether it 's continued now .
The team agreed that local authorities should have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision , if you like , the home school . However , they did n't want to make it too difficult , so that they have n't got any providers coming forward either . It was a little bit of a balancing act .
Janet Finch-Saunders AM suggested that local authorities should take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition . However , Sharon Davies pointed out that the difficulty with home tuition was that as a local authority , they were restricted on how much access they could get into the home . Therefore , it was really difficult then to quality assure , because unless the families invited us in there was very little .
The home-tuition staff work for the local authority . They do n't use agency staff , for instance , to go in and provide a few hours of provision , or to go to the local library . For whatever reason their needs at the moment ca n't be met in a school or in approved provision , then the staff who do provide some education , or if it 's for medical reasons , they work for us in the local authorities .
Sian Gwenllian AM asked about the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum , and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them . David Hopkins answered that they were happy and content that that was moving along and that the balance was there . Where home tuition was provided through the local authority , as has been discussed , there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving . It 's more difficult where it 's being provided by a third party that 's been commissioned .
The major challenge was that there was n't the capacity for them to access professional training . There were networks now , there were conferences , it was an improving picture , but it was limited . There was no way that local authorities could encourage specialist teachers and educational psychologists to actually share expertise with independent providers of EOTAS . If they took them out of the provision , it would be difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands .
Janet Finch-Saunders AM asked if there were any issues relating to transport for EOTAS learners , particularly in more rural parts or areas of Wales . Nick Williams answered that there was a PRU provision in the north of Powys and one in the south of the county . However , the distances that those learners were having to travel were huge , so it was not such an issue .
This meeting was about the design of the remote control . Project Manager first introduced the new requirements of the project , which were that the product should only be used for television , and that the target group should be younger than 40 . Then , User Interface and Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the functions of the product , and the team agreed that the functions should be simple and easy to use . Then the team discussed how to implement the functions in the product . Finally , the team came to the conclusion that the new project requirements should be fulfilled by focusing on the younger generation .
The user interface designer suggested two types of remote controls : the multi-function remote control with many possibilities and the ease-of-use remote control which was easy to use with the less possibilities but a great feeling in touching the buttons . However , the project manager rejected the idea of a multi-functional remote control because it would not be easy to implement and it would be more expensive . User Interface preferred the easy-to-use one because it was more user-friendly and more trendy .
Industrial Designer did not agree with User Interface 's idea of the ten digits because he did not think it would be easy to find the remote control without it . Industrial Designer thought that the elder people would not want to use voice recognition because they did n't like voice recognition . However , Industrial Designer believed that the older people would be more willing to pay for the function of speech recognition .
User Interface preferred the ease-of-use remote control with the less possibilities but a great feeling in touching the buttons . User Interface believed that the easy to use remote control would be more trendy in user design . However , User Interface also suggested that the multi-function could be implemented in the design , but it should be a combination , but teletext buttons were not in the plan .
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should use infrared to send pulses of infrared light to a TV set . User Interface suggested that they could use a low-cost circuit board because most of the production cost were in this part of the equipment . Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to use a combination of both conventional and energy-friendly components . However , User Interface pointed out that the combination of the two types of components , the battery and the infrared diode , would use more energy than the conventional circuit board .
The team came up with two ways to prevent customers from losing their remote controls . The first one was to add an audio signal to the remote control to help users find it . The second was to design a special button to find the remote controls , like the one on the TV , which would be pressed by the user and the TV set would start to make a kind of weird sound and the buttons would beep .
Industrial Designer suggested that the team could incorporate a hybrid hybrid device which incorporated a solar panel and rechargeable batteries so that the device could charge itself when it was left in a light room . However , this idea was challenged by the Project Manager because of the cost . Industrial Designer insisted that the cradle was not a big problem and it would cost practically nothing .
This was the second meeting on the design of the remote control . The first one was about the prototype presentation of Industrial Designer 's presentation of the new remote control design . The second one was the discussion about the materials they would use and what kind of chip would be necessary . The third meeting was about how they would design the locator . The fourth meeting is about the budget of the project . The group discussed the cost of the product .
Industrial Designer proposed to make the remote control into a remote control with a power button and a menu button . The remote control would be made of plastic with a spongy rubbery feel and a button on the side to change the colour , according to the living room or whatever . There would be a button for the locator , which would be in the base of the control , and the beeper would be inside the button . In addition , there would be buttons for the channel change , volume up and down , and for the menu .
The group agreed that the remote control should be larger and the base would definitely be larger . However , the project manager did n't think it was comfortable to sit in the position of the remote because it was an awkward position . The user interface designer suggested that they could reduce the number of the buttons on the remote . The project manager agreed and suggested that the buttons could be made in different colours .
The team was satisfied with the process of the project . The prototype making was creatively stimulating and the product met all the criteria . The teamwork was great and everyone had a chance to contribute to the design of the product . Project Manager thought the team was great because they all worked well together . However , Project Manager did n't think the team did a great job in terms of the leadership and teamwork .
The group decided to change the aspect of the shape of the remote control to make it more comfortable to hold . They decided to make the base would definitely be larger , because some of the vegetables were not as easy to hold in the hand . However , the project manager did n't think this was comfortable to to sit there , like it was an awkward position .
Industrial Designer thought it was good that the project was a democratic process and everyone got to contribute . Project Manager thought the leadership was crap personally . However , User Interface thought it more than anything they did n't really have set roles so much , as they just would be like I do n't know , all had ideas about it but Project Manager agreed that the teamwork was good .
Industrial Designer was not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . He preferred to use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things . User Interface did n't like PowerPoint personally because he thought it was kinda stupid . So he made up his own stuff and wrote notes instead .
The meeting started off with a discussion on how to start off the meeting by doing the digits all at the same time . The professor suggested that the team could do this to save time , but the team was concerned that they would get distracted and confused . The meeting ended with the team discussing what the team should do to improve the model .
The thesis is about building a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain- general rules how things are construed . The idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistics relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what . The proposal is in the tourism domain .
The professor mentioned that the team had started to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way and that the plan was to see to what extent the rephrasing solved the problem . The professor also mentioned that there were two camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , and the team was trying to find a balance between the two approaches . The team was also trying to figure out how the Bayes-net could be incorporated into the model .
The professor mentioned that the team had started to look at people 's brains in a more direct way and that the plan was to see to what extent the team would get the same phenomena with stories about this . The professor also mentioned that there was a whole language learning story , including the rephrasing and the Bayes-net . The team was trying to figure out the best way to deal with the problem .
This was the second meeting on the conceptual design of the remote control . First , User Interface presented the three concepts of the controller . The first one was a Google controller , the second was a fancy controller , and the last one was an intelligent controller . User Interface suggested that the controller should be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . Project Manager agreed and suggested that they should use technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so they need to have some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and gestures .
User Interface presented three concepts in the user interface . The first one was a Google controller , the second was a fancy controller , and the last one was an intelligent controller . The user interface should be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions , so that users could easily recognize the controller among a lot of products . User Interface also proposed to use speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so the team agreed to use these technologies in the controller .
The user interface designer proposed the concept of an intelligent controller because he thought that users were not only interested in having speech or the gesture itself , but also in the function of the TV . He suggested that users could replace their controller with a controller with similar function if they did not have some function inside it . However , the industrial designer rejected the idea because he did not think it was necessary to design a new controller without any breakthrough features . Besides , he also pointed out that there was no big difference between the traditional controller and the intelligent controller .
The project manager thought that most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels , and if they do all the time the same gesture , they will get injuries because of that . Also , the project manager did not think it would be a good idea to have a family watching TV at the same time , and everyone wanting to change channel in thesame time would be at a disadvantage .
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control could be a combination of both wood and plastic . Project Manager thought that the combination of the two materials would add value to the product . However , Industrial Designer pointed out that adding the solar battery would increase the price of the product , so it would be better to have both of them . Industrial Designer also suggested that they could use the same remote control in different devices .
Industrial Designer proposed to use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation when discussing the industrial design of the remote control . However , the project manager raised the question of whether it would add a little bit of the price . Industrial Designer answered that it would be an added value also that would be compensated by the group .
Industrial Designer proposed to use a wooden remote control or a plastic remote control . Project Manager agreed to use the wooden one because it was more resistant and it would be more common . Industrial Designer also suggested that the remote control could be made of different kinds of buttons such as push buttons and some buttons were unlighted during the night so users could see them in the darkness .
Marketing suggested that users wanted a fancy look and feel , but they also wanted it to be technologically innovative . At the same time , it was important that it was easy to use . The team agreed that the remote control should not be too spongy and it should be natural . However , the Industrial Designer suggested that they could have wood in the bottom and some rubber for the buttons .
The marketing recommended to take the fashion trend of fruits and vegetables into account for the design of the remote control because it was really what people wanted . Besides , the marketing also suggested to have a spongy touch , which was the main point from the trend in fashion . However , the industrial designer pointed out that this idea was not suitable for the wooden design because it would n't fit with the idea of fashion . The marketing agreed and suggested that they could have wood for example in the bottom and maybe the base .
Marketing mentioned that people wanted to have a spongy touch on the remote control . However , the Industrial Designer pointed out that the material needed to be plastic-like , which did n't fit with the wooden design . Project Manager suggested that they could stay with wood because it was natural and it could be correlated to energy , solar energy , so the group decided to have both wood and rubber for the buttons .
The meeting started with a discussion about the conceptual model of the remote control . Project Manager first introduced the target market of the project , which was mainly made up of young people in Europe . The team agreed that the product should have a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel , and it should be innovative and technologically innovative . Then , the team discussed the material used on the remote controls and the type of buttons used on them . Then the team decided to use the same material as the current remote controls , but the team also agreed to use some of the new technology to make the product more user-friendly . Finally , the meeting ended with a group discussion on the
Marketing believed that the most important aspect for the market trend is the fancy look-and-feel of the remote control , instead of the current functional look and feel . Therefore , the product should be different from ordinary remote controls . Also , it should be easy to use and easy to learn .
Marketing suggested making a see-through one in a fruit front because it 's hot . Marketing also suggested that they could make five different fronts to start with , so they can make an extraordinary shape , like a sponge , which is another shape than a normal remote control has .
User Interface recommended to watch the first two presentations of the technology department to learn more about the technology innovation and recommended using speech as a technology innovation because it was only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . However , the project manager pointed out that it would be very difficult to to do it . User Interface agreed and suggested that the team should have some kind of gadget .
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should have a normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of things . User Interface suggested that they could use multiple scroll wheels for the volume . Project Manager agreed and proposed to use a recharger for the power source . However , Industrial Designer rejected the idea of using a rechargeable battery because it would not work in the dark room .
Project Manager agreed with User Interface that the remote control should be bigger and smaller . However , he did n't like the idea of speech recognition because he thought it would not fit in the modern theme as well . Project Manager thought that the focus of the remote should be on the basic buttons and the home base should be simple and simple .
Marketing first suggested putting the advanced chip inside the speech recognition . However , the group did n't know how much the chip would cost because they did not have any information about the cost . The User Interface suggested that the group could use the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker unit , which was a very small electronic unit , would give a standard answer after it recognise a question .
The meeting was the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic . The meeting was mainly about the situation with the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board , which was scheduled to go through some important and potentially detrimental regulatory changes very soon . The petitioners had asked the government to work with the provinces to find a strategy to jointly allow for the delivery of this life-saving medicine to Canadians across the country and to take a leadership role in negotiating a price for gene modulators throughout all the provinces of Canada . They also asked the minister to assure the committee that the government was doing everything in its power to ensure the safety of the people in the pandemic area .
The Prime Minister explained that the priority from the beginning has been to make sure that Canadians get the support they need . The priority was to get the help out to people and figure out , with retroactive action if necessary , where and when there may have been fraudulent use . Other parties might have made a different choice had they been in government , but the focus was getting help to people when they needed it as quickly as possible and cleaning it up afterwards .
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie said that the Prime Minister continued to support the profiteers because it was more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance . There were no conditions that would allow the government to tighten the screws on profITEers . Companies that legally took advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes would have access to the large employer emergency financing facility . The Prime Minister said that they were always looking for ways to reduce costs for consumers , and they were reassessing how to lower costs for the consumers .
Hon . Bill Blair suggested that the government should ban all military assault rifles , except for law enforcement and military purposes . However , the opposition party argued that they were not concerned with these types of farm rifles that were being used by the farmers and , in some cases , hunters . Hon . Ahmed Hussen answered that the minister was not aware of unopened mail being a widespread problem , and he was happy to work with the minister to see what happened in this individual case .
The opposition party pointed out that there was no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic , leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19 . However , the Prime Minister insisted that the government was serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians , and they would continue to do that . The opposition party also suggested that the opposition party was not satisfied with the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment .
Ms. Jenny Kwan suggested that there was a gap between program making and its implementation because the government had decided to implement a complicated program that left many people behind . However , the Prime Minister insisted that they had moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit , however , as the member pointed out , when one moves quickly and efficiently , there would be gaps , and that 's why they had been working diligently to try to fill those gaps . And they wanted to make sure that Canadians who need help , get it .
Hon . Judy Sgro ( Humber Riverblack creek , Lib . ) suggested that Canadian seniors were worried about COVID-19 . During this time , their costs had gone up , and many seniors were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic . Therefore , it was so important that the government be there to support them . Hon . Deb Schulte ( Minister of Families , Children and Social Development ) answered that the Canadian government had announced a one-time , tax-free payment of $ 300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $ 200 for seniorseligible for GIS . This means there would be up to $ 500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security
Hon . Chrystia Freeland explained that the government was continuing to work towards that end , and it was always very important to protect Canadians , and they were going to stick to that approach . However , the opposition party argued that the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada 's tourism industry . The minister assured the committee that Canada was committed to protecting the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada ' s tourist regions were ready when the economy reopens . The opposition party also questioned about the support for energy resources and tourism .
Hon . Chrystia Freeland said that the government was continuing to work towards that end . It was always very important to protect Canadians , and we were going to stick to that approach . Many people had lost their jobs and needed assistance from the government . That is why we were here , providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they can come out the other side .
The Canadian government had moved forward with a number of measures that were designed to be of assistance . With respect to rent support , they were encouraging landlords to support this measure . Obviously , rent and landlord-tenant relations were under provincial jurisdiction . At every opportunity I talked to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there . We believed this program had significant merit . It would require the provinces to step forward and enforce it .
The Minister of Fisheries , oceans and the Canadian coast guard explained that the government was looking at sector-specific areas to make sure that the issues were addressed . However , it was challenged by Mr. D'Entremont that most fishermen were not eligible for the wage subsidy program due to the stipulation that it can not be used for employees who are related to their employer . The minister explained that more needs to be done for the harvesters directly . The government was working with the cabinet colleagues to find solutions .
Hon . Anita Anand ( Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada ) explained that the government was aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needed , from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home . At the same time , the government were working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs . At this point , the primary focus was on front-line health care professionals , but they were also exploring federal government assistance in areas of essential services .
The oil and gas industry was under severe strain . Over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . The federal Liberal government 's response to the anti-Oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , Bill C-69 , which would prevent any major oil and Gas projects from being developed in Canada . These two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of Canada , causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels . To compound Alberta 's economic problems , the COVID-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil .
This meeting was about the detailed design of the remote control . First , the User Interface presented the prototype of the new remote control based on the previous discussion of the project . Then , the group evaluated the prototype . They agreed that the product should be the first of its kind in the market . They also agreed on the shape of the product , which was to be a combination of the traditional controller with a circle and a triangle base . Then the group discussed the cost of the prototype , which they agreed that it should be priced at 25 Euros and produced at a production cost of 12.5 Euros . After that , they discussed how to integrate the product into the current market .
The user interface designer first introduced the product as a mushroom design . The group agreed that the product looked like a mushroom , but it was not the same as the company 's yellow and red colour . The product was made by clay and it was made with a combination of the company colour and the shape of a triangle . There were two basic shapes in the product , the first was a circle and the second was a triangle piece . There was also a stable triangle base , which made it unlikely that the remote control would be lost , so it would be more convenient for users to use it .
The user interface suggested that the basic colour of the product should be yellow and red because it was the company colour and it was more attractive . The user interface also suggested that there should be two basic shapes in the product . The first one was a circle and the second was a triangle piece .
The marketing disagreed with the user interface designer on the shape of the product because he believed that the product was not like a mushroom because it was not in the trends and it was a vegetable . However , the User Interface Designer insisted that the marketing should not destroy the prototype because he thought it was quite convenient for the user to use the product .
The group agreed that the remote control had a fancy look and feel and the colour was attractive . However , it was not clear whether the product was fancy or not . It depended on how to define fancy . The group decided to evaluate the product on a one to seven scale , with one being true , and seven being false . They agreed that it was a fancy product and the color was attractive and the shape was unique . They also agreed on the function of voice recognition .
The group agreed that the design was technologically innovative because there was a microphone array inside the remote control , which could capture voice from different directions , and the technology inside the microphone could recognize simple vocal comments . Also , the group thought that the remote controls were easy to use because it was easy to find and use .
The marketing and the industrial designer disagreed with the user interface designer on whether the controller was easy to use because they thought it would be too fast to jump from one to twenty . They thought that it would depend on the angle of the controller to know which channel was the correct one . And they thought that the voice command was easy because it was just speaking .
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should have a low level chip on the outside , a low-level chip inside , and the low level chips inside the chip should be on a chip on print . Project Manager agreed and proposed to have a sample sensor , sample speaker , and sample sensor on print , but this idea was challenged by Industrial Designer and the User Interface , who argued that it would not be a good idea to use the solar cell because it would increase the price and the cost of the product .
The group decided to keep the solar cells because it would be interesting for the marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be able to sell the product . Also , the group agreed that the remote control would be easy to use and powerful , as it had only one button . Therefore , they did not need to redesign the product to make it more user-friendly .
The industrial designer disagreed with the marketing because he thought that the TV was not a long-term product . It would be better to follow the flow and make it now and after , if the people change their mind , change also the product . The industrial designer believed that it was better to keep the product in the market and change the appearance every two years .
This was the first meeting with the team members . Project Manager started the meeting by introducing the plan of the project . The team members got to know each other better by drawing out their favourite animals on the whiteboard . Then , the team discussed the functional design of the remote control . The project manager wanted the product to be original , trendy , appealing to a wide market , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . After that , the project manager introduced the target market as the international market . The remote control would be aimed at the global market and the team would be responsible for the detailed design
The group agreed that the remote control should be accessible and usable by all age groups . They also agreed that it should be user-friendly and easy to use . However , they did n't want to make it too complicated to use because they did not want to add a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do , and symbols that you do not necessarily understand .
Marketing suggested that the group could incorporate a menu display into the design of the remote control so that it would be easier to browse and navigate . Project Manager agreed and suggested that instead of having too many buttons and making it complicated for the user , they could have an LCD display or something like that on the front of the control .
Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should be self-intuitive so that the user can work out what everything is doing . He also mentioned that the older generation could n't even dream of texting or using the teletext function . Therefore , he suggested designing a remote control that was easy to use and easy to learn .
Industrial Designer agreed with Marketing that the remote control should be made of lightweight plastic , which is easily moulded and produced . However , Industrial Designer also pointed out that it does n't need to be fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone . Industrial Designer believed that using plastic does not make it cheaper , but it would probably be different and look a bit different .
Industrial Designer suggested that one point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . Project Manager disagreed with Industrial Designer and suggested that the product should be priced at twenty-five Euros , which was expensive . However , Industrial Designer insisted that they had to buy one , so Project Manager agreed . Then the group discussed whether to undercut the price , which would make the product look cheap or not .
Project Manager did not think it was a case of worrying about different languages and things like that . The remote control was going to be in the international market like Australia , America , and other countries . Therefore , Project Manager did n't think they had to worry about the business market and the target group .
The meeting began with the Industrial Designer 's presentation on the working design of the remote control . Project Manager introduced the new remote control project as a universal control , one handset for all , TV , video equipment . The team discussed the size of the control , reducing the size and the type of buttons on the remote . The group decided to use a flip-open design , reduce the number of buttons , and add an electronic panel for further features like programming . The meeting ended with a discussion on the battery issue and the design of buttons .
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be small and easy to carry . Project Manager agreed and suggested that they could look at the power source for the batteries . However , Industrial Designer was not sure whether they wanted to focus on the size issue because most of the remote controls were powered by triple A batteries but those can be quite bulky so the group decided to look at something else so they could shrink down the size of the control . Then the group discussed about the power consumption of the controller .
Industrial Designer thought that most remote controls used some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue . However , he was not sure whether they wanted to look at the size issue because most of them were powered by triple A batteries but those can be quite bulky so he suggested that they could look at something else so they could shrink down the size of the control .
According to the market research , seventy-five percent of users found most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Thirty-four percent of people took too much time to learn to use the remote control . Fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of buttons , so the team had to cut back on cost if they did n't have so many functions on the remote controls . The team also had to make some adjustments to the design of the product due to market research results .
Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should be able to let off a loud noise to let users know where it is when it is lost in the room . However , the project manager pointed out that the cost of the alarm would be higher than the budget limit . Therefore , Industrial Designer suggested that they could take a cheaper option which still does the same thing .
Industrial Designer mentioned that the company could make the remote control smaller or bigger in order to meet the needs of the market . User Interface suggested that a touch screen could be a better option for that . Industrial Designer agreed and suggested that they could have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others . Project Manager agreed and proposed to design one product for each country .
The group agreed that the remote control should be more like a box , rather than like a sea-shell . The group also agreed on the idea of a flip-screen that could be inserted in between the two covers , which could prevent repetitive strain injury and make the product more user-friendly . Also , the group agreed to use the company logo in the corner of the model , which was suggested by User Interface .
The meeting began with a discussion about the best way to implement the transcriber interface in the model . The professor suggested that the team could do a mock-up of the interface and then test the model on a subset of the digits . The team also discussed how the model could be further improved by performing experiments on the same set of digits at the same time .
PhD G informed the team that the DARPA meeting was in mid July . The team agreed that the transcriber interface would be the focus of the meeting and that they would have to figure out a way for the team to meet with DARPA and present their work to the team .
The team was working on a mock-up of the transcriber interface for DARPA . The team was trying to figure out the best way to incorporate the interface into the transcriptions . The professor suggested that the team could do a demo of the interface in order to see if the interface could be incorporated into the transcripts .
Transcribers were expected to be hired to transcribe more speech and non-speech utterances . The team was concerned that they could run into a problem later if they hired too many transcribers at once . The professor suggested that the team could adjust the transcriptions once in a while , which would not be a problem if they had five on staff at any given time .
PhD C explained that the team would like to move to doing the recognition on automatic segmentations because in all their previous experiments , they were essentially cheating by having the hand- segmentations as the basis of the recognition . The team wanted to make sure that the segmenter was not cheating by using hand-segmentations as a basis for the recognition process .
The segmenter is working well on automatic segmentation . The professor suggested that the team should increase the error rate to improve the performance of the model . The team is discussing whether to move to doing the recognition on automatic segmentsations . This is because in all the previous experiments , the team was essentially cheating by having the hand- segmentations as the basis of the recognition .
PhD C suggested that they should consider doing some extra things , like retraining or adapting the models for background noise to the to this environment , for instance . This would involve using Thilo 's posteriors or some kind of pre-segmentation . However , at the time , the segmenter was not performing as well as it could .
The meeting began with a review of the ASRU results . The team was concerned that the Aurora HTK system was not performing as well as they expected it to . The professor explained that the team was dealing with rever reverberation , and the technique they were using to deal with the reverberation worked really well . They wanted to know how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz . They also wanted to find out how the Aurora system would perform at a lower frequency . The meeting ended with a discussion on how the team could further improve the model .
The team was concerned that the number of deletions would increase . The professor explained that the model was performing better without the neural network , but it was still not good enough . The team also wanted to know if the noise subtraction was subtracting off speech . The model performed better with the neural net , but the results were still not great .
The professor was concerned that the neural net was not helping the model perform as well as he expected it to . He wanted to know if the model was better with a side path . He thought it would be interesting to see what the net effect was on the model . He also suggested that the model should be focused on improving the net and not just on the improvement of the model with the side-path .
The team thought that the noise subtraction was subtracting off speech . They wanted to know if the neural net was hurting the model . The professor suggested that the model was better without the neural network . The team agreed that it would be interesting to see if the results were a little bit worse with the neural nets .
PhD C explained that the VAD was using the same approach as the previous model , which was using noise compensation after noise compensation . The only thing that had changed was the estimation of the silence probabilities . The model was based on the system that had a fifty- three point sixty- six percent improvement . The VAD used nine frames of six features from C-zero to C-five , plus the first derivatives , and it had one hundred hidden units . The latency of the model was two hundred and twenty milliseconds .
The professor was concerned that the VAD was used for on-line normalization before the delta computation . He wanted to know the exact latency of the model . He thought that the professor was confused because the professor thought the model was doing fine with two hundred milliseconds of VAD latency . The professor also wanted to make sure that the model did not use too much time for the cleaning of the speech .
PhD C explained that there was a delta at the input , which was one hundred milliseconds for smoothing . There was also a 100 milliseconds delay for the filtering of silence probabilities . There were also 20 milliseconds for the LDA filters . PhD C said that the total latency was two hundred and ten milliseconds .
This meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control . The first thing to aim for is the fancy look and feel . Next comes the technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And the last thing is the easy to use . The group discussed the material of the case , the buttons and the wheels , the circuit board , and the beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . They decided to use a hard plastic or some other material case to protect the electronics and the locator , and they would need to custom design a circuit board . They would use the next higher grade chip .
Marketing suggested that the first thing to aim for is a fancy look and feel . Next , the group discussed whether to print the fruit and vegetable theme on the remote control and whether to make the remote look like a fruit . Then , the Industrial Designer proposed to use a sort of rubber that 's in like those stress ball things , which would be spongy . The User Interface suggested using a combination of both rubber and plastic . The group agreed to use both of them .
The Industrial Designer said that they would be custom designing the case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And they would need to custom design a circuit board , because the circuit board had to take the button input and send it to the output so you had to design that each time . They could use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it 's really heavy .
Industrial Designer first proposed to have a screen with music because people were looking for a specific song or whatever . However , User Interface pointed out that people would have to scroll to get channels . Project Manager agreed that the screen could come up on the telly , but User Interface insisted that people could switch to a mode where they could go back and forth and choose if they want to use the screen or the wheel .
Industrial Designer suggested that the team could use batteries , solar power , and a dynamo . However , Project Manager pointed out that solar power was not available with the rubber case , so they could not use it . Project Manager also suggested that they could use Kryptonite , which was a kinetic thing where you would basically have to wind it yourself . The team agreed that the dynamo would be interesting , but it would not be cheap .
The Industrial Designer thought that a dynamo was like a bicycle mechanism . It was like if something moves , it stores energy . The other option was a kinetic thing where you would basically have to wind it yourself . However , the Industrial Designer did not like the idea of doing a wind-up or the dynamo or a solar power because it was not available with the rubber case anyways .
Industrial Designer did n't know the cost of the Kryptonite because he had n't had enough data to figure out the exact cost . However , he did not think it would be that much of a problem . Most of the stuff was pretty cheap though bought in bulk , and the chip was probably the most expensive part .
This meeting was about the conceptual design of the new remote control . Project Manager firstly introduced the market trends , which included fancy look and feel , technologically innovative and easy to use . Then , the group discussed the features of the remote control , including the incorporation of the image of the company into it and the importance of the user-friendly interface . The group then talked about the components of the product , which include the material , the interface , the buttons , the chip , the LCD screen , the speaker , and the speaker . They also discussed the functions of the device , such as speech recognition , the location function , the power source , the menu button , the scroll wheel , the volume button ,
The team agreed that the most important aspect for remote control was fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look andfeel of remote controls . They also wanted the remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , it should be easy to use . The team also agreed on the idea of a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal , and they were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and the port and an alarm for getting it lost .
In the last meeting , the team decided on leaving out the voice recognition , a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal . They were also going to look into the rechargeable batteries , the port and an alarm for getting it lost , and they were going to think about the port for getting the remote control lost . The market was going to be young , business , kind of range .
Marketing suggested that the most important aspect for the remote control was fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look andfeel of remote controls . They also wanted a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as they predicted , that it should be easy to use . Project Manager agreed that the first of those findings , fancy look-and-feel , was twice as important as the second , technologically innovativeness , which was in turn twice asimportant as being easy touse .
Industrial Designer mentioned that most current remotes use the chip called the T A double one eight three five which is used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it 's pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the moment . Most remotes also use a printed circuit board , which basically has contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it 'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out in the sequence of on and off bursts .
Industrial Designer thought that the standard double A and triple A batteries were a bit too bulky at the moment , while the kinetic charging was more user-friendly . However , Industrial Designer did n't think that the amount the amount of moving around would be doing all the time would would charge it up , so it would n't be necessary to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . Also , the industrial designer did not think it was necessary to change the battery .
Industrial Designer first proposed to use plastic as the main case case housing . However , the team was concerned that it would be too expensive to make a new case for it . Then , Marketing proposed to make the basic mould out of plastic but have a rubber cover that goes over , which would give the spongy feel and allow the user to change the cover . The team agreed to use rubber as the material of the case .
Industrial Designer first proposed to have a bare Pcb circuit board with buttons in different colours so that just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if they were close enough . However , the problem with this was that it was flat and so they ca n't do lots of curve curved things with it . Industrial Designer then suggested that they could have rubber buttons which were made of this material which was anti-RSI so that the buttons could be arranged in a sort of array and they could arrange the buttons on the screen in a set thing and have them like a touch .
Marketing 's suggestion of a sort of stylus to press the touch screen on the device when discussing the design of actual components was not adopted by the team for fear that users would find it irritating to use a touch-pad very fast compared to a button , which was easy to replace as well as cheap .
Marketing 's idea of putting mirrors on the device was not adopted by the team for fear that the remote control would react to the turn of the body and give off an advertising display . However , the team agreed to leave the idea of the mirror on the side because it would not cost much and it would be hard for the team to remove it .
Industrial Designer firstly presented the design of the actual components and the availability of the components they have in stock at the moment . The main idea of the remote control was just to get buttons and it should activate things on the TV . Then , the group discussed the battery options . The group decided to use a rechargeable battery , but the Industrial Designer pointed out that it would be better if the battery was in a smaller size so that it could charge through the day and then be charged for the evening . They also discussed the idea of using a wind-up radio , which was not necessary for most people .
The user interface designer suggested that the new remote should be different from the normal remotes because it should be more user-friendly and the user interface design should be simple and easy to use . In addition , the design of the remote should not be too complicated and too many buttons should be put on the remote . Also , the new remotes should have a combination of boards and on the top , there should be repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device .
Industrial Designer suggested that they could start with the black and white one and could upgrade later . Project Manager agreed . However , Project Manager pointed out that the speech recognition feature was not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour because if they had just got a black andwhite one , it would not be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them .
This was the first meeting of a new product project for television remote control . Project Manager started the meeting by introducing the target market and the plan of the project . Then , User Interface and Industrial Designer presented the user requirements of the remote control , which included its appearance , functions and user-friendly features . The group then discussed the technical functions of the product , including the buttons , the LCD display , the buttons on the remote controls , and the buttons for the buttons to be put on the TV screen . After that , the group discussed the functional design of the new product , which was to be a remote control for television . The meeting ended with a discussion about the working design of buttons and buttons .
Industrial Designer proposed that the remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments should be the same as the way to control the TV . User Interface proposed that it should be a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store . Project Manager agreed with Industrial Designer and User Interface that the product should be sold to the public and it should fit every device . However , Industrial Designer pointed out that they were not developing this product for a specific vendor .
User Interface suggested that the remote control should be a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store . However , the Industrial Designer pointed out that they were not developing this product for a specific vendor , and they wanted to sell it to a very broad public , so it should fit to every device . User Interface agreed with Industrial Designer that the technical function was pure and it should change the state of the TV , which was the basic technical function .
Industrial Designer thought a modern remote control should control a device diverse subset of equipment . For instance , one remote control for all the equipment . And for a cell phone , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . Industrial Designer also proposed some new technical possibilities which were available and which might be interesting to implement in the product .
Industrial Designer suggested that they should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other . Project Manager suggested that the remote control should be rechargeable very easily and it should not consume too much power . However , User Interface pointed out that the infrared was a little bit old-fashioned and it would be annoying if users had to change the batteries every other week . Industrial Designer agreed that Bluetooth was more convenient and cost-effective . But Project Manager also raised the point that the device should not use a lot of power .
Industrial Designer suggested that the team should think about the way how the remote control and TV should communicate with each other . He suggested that all the TVs were equipped with infrared , so it was cost-effective . However , User Interface pointed out that the infrared was a little bit old-fashioned , so the team could use Bluetooth instead . Industrial Designer agreed and suggested that they could equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
User Interface pointed out that Bluetooth would use a lot of power and was inconvenient for users to change the batteries every other week . User Interface also mentioned that cell phones had integrated Bluetooth also and it seemed to work quite okay . However , User Interface did not want to use Bluetooth all the time , twenty-four hours a day .
